# ts

Welcome to the `ts` project!

## Introduction

This repository serves as a container for TypeScript experiments, examples from books or tutorials, and references that I intend to keep documented and use along the way in my career as a developer.

## How to navigate the repository

This is my initial idea on how to structure this repository: 
1.  [Projects](projects/)
    - [BookProjects](projects/book-pr/): Store projects created while following books or tutorials. Can be sub-categorized further based on the book or tutorial name.
    - [ReferenceProjects](projects/reference-pr/): Could include template or boilerplate projects that demonstrate specific setups or functionalities
    - [ExperimentalProjects](projects/experiment-pr/): Could include experiments, e.g. repeating  wi little value for the reader
2. [Documentation](documentation/)
    - Guides: Written guides or notes I've compiled on TypeScript concepts or project setups.
    - CheatSheets: Quick reference sheets that me, you or others can quickly skim through.
    - PDFs: important documents converted to PDFs for easy sharing or printing.
3. Examples
    - BasicExamples: Simple scripts or applications demonstrating core TypeScript functionalities.
    - AdvancedExamples: More complex examples that might integrate multiple technologies or show off advanced TypeScript features.
4. Resources
    - Books: PDFs or links to books and other long-form content.
    - Articles: Shorter articles or blog posts.
    - Videos: Links to tutorial videos or explanatory videos that have been useful.
5. Tools
    - Scripts: Utility scripts that can help in development or maintenance tasks.
    - Configurations: Common configuration files for various environments or setups.
